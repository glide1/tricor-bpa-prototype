[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TRI-COR/tricor-bpa-prototype.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/TRI-COR/tricor-bpa-prototype)

#Prerequisites:

* node version ^0.12
* npm version ^2.11

Node and npm are available on https://nodejs.org. Alternatively, use N or NVM to manage node installations.

After cloning run

`>npm install <project directory>`

To run the server run

`cd <project directory> && npm run start`

For development you probably want gulp installed.

`>npm install -g gulp`

Then run gulp from the project directory

`> gulp`

This will run the server and watchers for modifications to files.
