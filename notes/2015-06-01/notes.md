###Notes for 2015-06-01

* Reviewed notes and understanding of API
* Decided on abstract use case: finding drugs by entering/selecting symptoms
** The application would allow users to browse a collection of drugs, using symptoms as primary means of filtering
** Created paper sketch of the concept which included facets that users select to dynamically update a list of drugs. Selecting a drug would display a view with drug details. The drug details would include things like drug description, side effects, uses, active ingrediets with purpose and alternatives to the drug in question.
* The application will use responsive web design to allow users to access the service from different devices.
* Decision: the interface engineer will upload a sketch of the discussion as a first "prototype" of the UI and document the use case and concept.
